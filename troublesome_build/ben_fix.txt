# ideally, you shouldnt need to run this. Past ben should have compiled the following into a Docker build
# and rebuilt it himself, so Minecraft env is already cached into the image and no further shenanigans have
# to be in the way. But just in case, here it is

# from scratch docker command

docker run --gpus=all -v '/mnt/e/AutonoMC:/AutonoMC'  -it -d -p 8080:8080 minedojo/minedojo:latest tail -f /dev/null
docker exec -it 'container_id' /bin/bash

# -v mount flag can be replaced with wherever you keep AutonoMC / troublesome_build's superdirectory.

sudo cp /AutonoMC/troublesome_build/build.gradle /opt/conda/lib/python3.9/site-packages/minedojo/sim/Malmo/Minecraft/

# fixes gradle isntall configuration, pointing it to /AutonoMC/troublesome_build/.
