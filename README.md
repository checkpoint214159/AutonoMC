# AutonoMC

Hi, im ben. I have nothing better to do with my life except ponder its existence and derivations. Lets make a minecraft agent!


## My approach

I play to merge the fields of Active Inference and Deep Learning to create a never-before seen kind of agent; one whose understanding of the world so greatly differs from anything we've ever seen.

The rough idea is to create a generative model over state, observation, action, preference and time space, based on the ideas of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (but time is not discrete lol). This approach will utilise the following: (not general pls sort later)

- Pretraining on Vision and/or Language data via MineCLIP
- Generative model formed from Variational Bayes ideas
- Diffusion??? Who knows lol
- Minecraft as an environment with infinite possibilities
